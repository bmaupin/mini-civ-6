This is a mod for Sid Meier's Civilization VI (Civ 6). The overall goal of the mod is to modify the game so that it can be completed in shorter sessions, ideally 1-2 hours.

Here are some instructions:

- Please remember this is a video game
- Use British spelling
- Civ 6 uses the Havok Script Lua engine
  - In particular, Havok Script adds types to Lua which aren't compatible with the Lua language server used by the vscode extension, so please remove types from Lua code
- Civ 6 uses SQLite
