# Mini Civ 6

📌 [See my other Civ projects here](https://github.com/search?q=user%3Abmaupin+topic%3Acivilization&type=Repositories)

This is a mod to Sid Meier's Civilization VI to allow much shorter games.

## Installation

Because the mod is [unfinished](#status), only [manual installation](#manual-installation) is possible at this time.

## Status

> [!TIP]
> If you would like a Civ-like game that plays much more quickly, I recommend [Ozymandias](https://goblinzstudio.com/game/ozymandias/) instead.

The mod is playable but unfinished.

Civ 6 adds a lot of complexity compared to other Civ titles, which makes it difficult and tedious to try to play quickly and leads to decision fatigue. Unfortunately removing or simplifying these systems mostly just made the game less interesting.

## Features

#### Very small maps

Map sizes have been reduced to 16% of their original size (40% of their height and 40% of their width). This alone has the biggest impact on the length of the game. In addition to games being shorter, the game as a whole runs faster as there is less to process (e.g. much less wait time between turns).

#### Default game speed set to online

The default game speed has been set to online in order to speed up gameplay.

#### Reduced barbarian difficulty

Barbarians in Civ 6 are notoriously more aggressive, and dealing with them takes up a lot more time in the early game. Their aggressiveness has been drastically reduced for quicker gameplay.

#### Changes to builders

Default charges for builders have been doubled (from 3 to 6) in order to speed up gameplay.

#### City state features removed

If city states are set to 0 and Barbarian Clans mode isn't checked, city state features are removed from the game such as the ability to acquire envoys as well as UI elements referencing city states.

#### New game options

Some new game options have been added to better facilitate quicker games:

👉 Note that there hasn't been much work to balance these

- No Great People
  - Removes great people from the game
- No Military
  - Removes military and all related items (units, buildings, techs, etc) from the game and also disables barbarians
- No Policies
  - Removes policy cards completely from the game and modifies the Governments screen to not show the Policy tab
- No Religion
  - Removes religion, faith, pantheons and all related items from the game

#### Civic/tech boosted popups disabled

> Disables the Tech Boosted (Eureka) and Civic Boosted (Inspiration) popup windows which interrupts your gameplay. Tech boosted and Civic boosted notification still appear on notification panel and the popup can be displayed by clicking on notification.
